I still consider myself a green hat but I'm not a script kiddie.

I develop my own tools, mostly around personal tools and industrial automation.

I worked at the grocery store for years while I went to college. I'm a damn good TTRPG referee too-- and no applications on my phone could do the one thing I needed. I just wanted a list within a list when I rolled a random die. Roll a d10, and on a 10, roll another die. Sounds simple, right? Well no application on my mobile could possibly do this impossible task. I would have good lengths of time between customers that I would do my puny little worldbuilding, and every app would waste what precious little time I had on making me watch an advertisement. 

I don't care how little money I was making per hour at the time. I don't care how small a distraction embarassingly derails entire plans, on or off my medication. I don't care how trivial my task is. I'm not going to be treated like this by my own device.

Neither you or I need to watch ads to do things that we need or want to do.
